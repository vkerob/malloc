# Malloc

The project, as defined by school 42, aims to implement the malloc function from the standard libc library.

WARNING! This implementation is not that of the libc; it only follows certain principles and is therefore simplified.\
If you want to see what the libc implementation looks like, a link is provided in the Documentation section.

## Importante informations are in malloc.h
